Adds breadcrumb navigation showing the visitor's path to their current location.

== Description ==

Breadcrumb NavXT, the successor to the popular WordPress plugin Breadcrumb Navigation XT, was written from the ground up to be better than its ancestor. This plugin generates locational breadcrumb trails for your WordPress powered blog or website. These breadcrumb trails are highly customizable to suit the needs of just about any website running WordPress. The Administrative interface makes setting options easy, while a direct class access is available for theme developers and more adventurous users.

= PHP Requirements =
Breadcrumb NavXT 5.2 and newer require PHP5.3
Breadcrumb NavXT 5.1.1 and older require PHP5.2

= Features (non-exhaustive) =
* RDFa format Schema.org BreadcrumbList compatible breadcrumb generation.
* Extensive breadcrumb customization control via a settings page with appropriate default values for most use cases.
* Network admin settings page for managing breadcrumb settings for all subsites with [configurable global priority](http://mtekk.us/archives/guides/controlling-breadcrumb-navxt-settings-from-the-network-settings-page/ "Go to the article on configuring the network settings priority.").
* Built in WordPress Widget.
* Extensible via OOP and provided [actions](http://mtekk.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/breadcrumb-navxt-doc/2/#action_reference "Go to the Breadcrumb NavXT Documentation's action reference.") and [filters](http://mtekk.us/code/breadcrumb-navxt/breadcrumb-navxt-doc/2/#filter_reference "Go to the Breadcrumb NavXT Documentation's filter reference.").
* WPML compatible (enhanced compatibility with WPML extensions plugin).
* bbPress compatible (enhanced compatibility with bbPress extension plugin).

= Translations =

Breadcrumb NavXT now supports WordPress.org language packs. Want to translate Breadcrumb NavXT? Visit [Breadcrumb NavXT's WordPress.org translation project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/breadcrumb-navxt/).

== Installation ==
Open the appropriate file for your theme (typically header.php). This can be done within WordPress’ administration panel through Presentation > Theme Editor or through your favorite text editor. Place the following code where you want the breadcrumb trail to appear.
`<div class="breadcrumbs" typeof="BreadcrumbList" vocab="http://schema.org/">
    <?php if(function_exists('bcn_display'))
    {
        bcn_display();
    }?>
</div>`
Save the file (upload if applicable). Now you should have a breadcrumb trail on your WordPress powered site. To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT.
