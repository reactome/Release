Check email allows you to test if your WordPress installation is sending emails correctly by sending a test email to an address of your choice. Allows overriding of email headers and carbon copying to another address.

== Description ==

Don't know if your WordPress installation is sending emails? Use this simple plugin to find out. It will send a simple test email to an email address of your choice, and to help troubleshoot any problems you can also override the custom headers wth your own values.

Please be aware this is a very early version of the plugin, and with so many people having trouble with email I expect this plugin to cause lots of questions and feature requests.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin from the plugin repository and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you write this plugin? =

Someone using one of my other plugins had trouble with emails not being sent. I knocked this together to help him (and anyone else).
