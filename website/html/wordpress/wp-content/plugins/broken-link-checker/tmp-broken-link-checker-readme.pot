#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll) and other content and looking for links.

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel - <em>Tools -&gt; Broken Links</em>.

E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker</em>)."
