#! /bin/bash

# This script will print out some basic memory usage information.
# It will print amount of memory available (in kb and gb) for allocation,
# the total amount of memory on the system (in kb and gb),
# And the amount available as a percentage.
# If the amount available is less than $THRESHOLD, a message will be printed to stderr.
#
# This job is meant to be run with cron. Cron will send anything on stderr to the email
# address in the cronfile's MAILTO field.
#
# This script requires the program 'bc' to be installed to perform calculations.
