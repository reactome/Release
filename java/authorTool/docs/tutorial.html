<li><a href="#reactionNode">Add reaction nodes to the pathway</a></li>
<li><a href="#reference">Add references</a></li>
<li><a href="#task">Finish tasks</a></li>
<li><a href="#end">End</a></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="install" id="install" />1. Install the Reactome author tool</h2>
<p>
You can download an installer from <a href="http://brie8.cshl.org/download/tools/authorTool/install.htm">the
Reactome download site</a>. Choose the appropriate installer for your platform.
</p>
<p>
After you download the installer, double click the installer to start the installation. Follow the instructions to finish the installation. Under Windows, the default installation directory is Program Files/ReactomeAuthorTool, and the directory contents should look like this:
<br />
<img src="images/InstallFolder.gif" width="811" height="233" />
</p>
<h2><a name="launch" id="launch" />2. Launch the Reactome author tool</h2>
<p>
Double click the installed file &quot;GKAuthorTool.exe&quot; to launch the author tool.
</p>
<h2><a name="newProject" id="newProject" />3. Create a new project</h2>
<p>
To create a new project, click &quot;New Project&quot; under the File menu, type Ctrl-N, or click the new project button <img src="images/NewProjectBtn.gif" width="22" height="21"> in the toolbar. Input "Mitotic Cell Cycle" as the display name, and select "Homo sapiens" for Taxon in the Taxon/Localization tab. Click the OK button in the property dialog to create the new project.
<br />
<img src="images/NewProjectProp.gif" />
<br />
<br />
<img src="images/NewProjectProp1.gif" />
</p>
<p>
An application window will open for the new project, divided into five sections. The top-left pane is the process tree where all objects added to the opened project are listed. The bottom-left tree lists entities
copied from the central Reactome knowledgebase, that are available to be used in reactions created in the editing process. The right pane is the task tree for each newly created molecule, reaction and pathway. This tree lists all the tasks needed to annotate that molecule, reaction or pathway fully.
As tasks are successfully completed, task names are automatically removed from this list. The top panel in the center of the window is
the graphic editor pane. This panel is used to create new molecules and complexes, organize these into reactions in which they participate, and arrange these reactions into pathways. The bottom panel in the center of the window is the property pane. It is used to edit properties of the object displayed in the graphic editor panel.
<br>
<img src="images/OverallView.gif" />
</p>
<p>
Double click an empty area of the graphic editor panel for "Mitotic Cell Cycle" pathway to bring up the property dialog for this pathway. Select the description tab. Copy and paste this sentence into the text area of the dialog: "The replication of the genome and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells are controlled by a series of events collectively known as the cell cycle." Click "OK" to close the dialog. Note that the task "Describe Mitotic Cell Cycle" has been removed from the task panel.
</p>
<h2></a><a name="save" id="save" />4. Save the project</h2>
<p>
You should save your newly created project frequently to protect your newly created data. Click "Save Project" under the File menu, type Ctrl-S, or click the save button <img src="images/SaveBtn.gif" /> in the menu bar.
(Note: most common operations in the author tool can be started either by choosing an item under a drop-down menu, by clicking a button on the menu bar, or by typing a Ctrl-letter sequence. Some can also be started by right-clicking the appropriate object in the application window. However, the operation works the same way, no matter how you start it.)
 You are asked for a new file name. Type "MitoticCellCycle". The project is saved as an XML file with the default extension ".gkb": MitoticCellCycle.gkb.
</p>
<h2></a><a name="fristLevel" id="firstLevel" />5. Create first level events</h2>
<p>
To create a new sub-pathway under Mitotic Cell Cycle, right-click the Mitotic Cell Cycle graphic editor panel to bring up the popup menu to choose "Insert Pathway", choose "Insert Pathway" under the Draw menu, type Ctrl-P, or click the insert pathway button on the menu bar. Input "G1 Phase" as the display name for this pathway. Note the appearance of a new set of tasks in the right-hand panel of the window. Note also that the taxon property for "G1 Phase" is automatically set to "Homo sapiens", consistent with the taxon chosen for the larger pathway, Mitotic Cell Cycle, of which it is a part.
</p>
<p>Repeat these steps to create sub pathways G1/S Transition, S Phase, G2 Phase, G2/M
Transition, M Phase, and M/G1 Transition.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, to create a new molecule ("entity"), complex, reaction, or flow arrow (to connect successive reactions in a pathway), use the "Insert Entity" (Ctrl-E), "Insert Complex" (Ctrl-M), "Insert Reaction" (Ctrl-R), or "Insert Flow Arrow" (Ctrl-F) options of the Draw menu, see below.
</p>
<p>
Now we want to annotate causal or temporal relationships (dependencies) among these sub pathways. For example, we want to indicate that G1 Phase precedes G1/S Transition. The easiest way to do this is to select G1 Phase by clicking the G1 Phase node in the graphic editor panel, move the mouse cursor a little bit to display the link widgets (the four gray arrows around the node), choose one outbound arrow (the top or right one) and drag it to G1/S Transition node. Release the arrow after the color of G1/Transition node changes to green. G1 Phase and G1/S Transition are now linked together, and the direction of the arrow indicates the order of the events.
</p>
<p>
Use the same method to create dependences between G1/S Transition and S Phase, S Phase and G2 Phase, G2 Phase and G2/M Phase, G2/M Phase and M Phase, M Phase and M/G1 Transition, and M/G1 Transition and G1 Phase.
</p>
<p>
You may want to improve the layout of these pathways and dependencies.
You can use an automatic layout (Click button </a><img border="0" src="images/AutoLayoutBtn.gif" width="23" height="20">,
or use shortcut F4 key). Alternatively, you can arrange sub-pathways
manually. Here, drag the sub-pathway objects (G1 phase, etc.) into a circular arrangement to represent the cell cycle. The flow arrows will automatically follow the objects they link.
</p>
<p>
You can also change the default background and text colors for a node, and the line color and the width for an edge to improve the appearance of the layout. Here we want to use blue as background and yellow as text color for G1 Phase, S Phase, G2 Phase, and M Phase. Click G1 Phase to select it. Right click to bring up the popup menu. Select "Format Display". The Format Node Display dialog appears. Click <img src="images/Browser.gif" /> to choose colors for text and background. Choose a blue color for background, and a yellow color for text. The selected color is displayed in the preview pane immediately. Do same thing for S Phase, G2 Phase and M Phase. You
may also change the line color and width for an edge by selecting that edge and clicking "Format Display" popup menu.
<br />

<p>
The following image is the pathway we created. Click <img src="images/SaveBtn.gif" /> to save the changes.
<br />

</p>
</a>
<h2><a name="secondLevel" id="secondLevel" />6. Create second level events</h2>
<p>
Now we want to add second level events to G1/S Transition pathway. Double click the "G1/S Transition pathway" node to open a pathway editor for G1/S Transition pathway. Insert three pathways, "Cyclin E associated events during G1/S transition", "G1/S-Specific Transciption", and "Activation of the pre-replication complex" (See
</a> <a href="#firstLevel">step 5</a>). Since there are no dependencies among these three pathways, no flow arrows are needed. Save the project.
</p>
<h2><a name="reactionNode" id="reactionNode" />7. Add reaction nodes to the pathway</h2>
<p>
The Pathway "Activation of the pre-replicative complex" contains several reactions.
Reactions can only be rendered as nodes in pathways.
</p>
<p>
Double click the "Activation of the pre-replicative complex" pathway node to open a pathway editor. Click the "Insert Reaction" button <img src="images/InsertReactionBtn.gif" />. A reaction property dialog appears. Input "Mcm10 associates with the pre-replicative complex, stabilizing Mcm2-7" as display name. Click OK. A node for this reaction is inserted into the pathway editor. Using the same method, insert the following reaction nodes:
<ul>
<li>Cdt1 is displaced from the pre-replicative complex</li>
<li>CDK and DDK associate with the Mcm10:pre-replicativev complex</li>
<li>Mcm2-7 is phosphorylated by DDK</li>
<li>DNA Replication Factor A (RPA) associates with the pre-replicative complex at the origin</li>
<li>DNA polymerase alpha:primase binds at the origin</li>
<li>DNA polymerase epsilon binds at the origin</li>
</ul>
<p>And one sub pathway: Cdc45 associates with the pre-replicative complex at the origin.</p>
<p>
There are dependencies among the reactions we just inserted. Before continuing, save the changes. Insert flow arrows, and attach reaction nodes to the flow arrows as above(see
</a> <a href="#firstLevel">step 5</a>).  You don't need to consider the layout while attaching nodes to edges. After attaching is done, click the automatic layout button <img src="images/AutoLayoutBtn.gif" /> to do layout.
<br />
<img src="images/InsertReactions.gif" />
</p>
<p>
A reaction should have inputs, outputs and/or catalysts. Now we want to add inputs, outputs and catalysts to the reactions. Double click the reaction node "Mcm10 associates with the pre-replicative complex, stabilizing Mcm2-7" to open a reaction editor for this reaction. Right click the graphic panel to bring up the popup menu. Select menu item "Insert Entity As Input" to bring up the entity property dialog. Input "Mcm10" as the display name, and click OK button. Right click the graphic panel and select "Insert Complex As Input" to add a new complex "pre-replicative complex" as another input. Use a similar way to add a complex "Mcm10:pre-replicative complex" as the output. Automatically lay out the reaction with the "Auto layout" popup menu.
<br />
<img src="images/Mcm10AssociatePrereplicativeComplex.gif" />
<br />
Reaction "Mcm10 associates with the pre-replicative complex" is a binding reaction. The output is a complex of Mcm10 protein and the pre-replicative complex. The author tool can be used to create this complex graphically from its components. Double click the complex node "Mcm10:pre-replicative complex" to open a complex editor. Hold the ctrl key, and click "Mcm10" and "pre-replicative complex" in the left process tree (Mitotic Cell Cycle/"G1/S Transition"/Activation of the pre-replication complex) to select these two nodes. Drag and drop these two nodes to the graphic panel for "Mcm10:pre-replicative complex". Using automatic layout or manually arrange the positions of these two nodes. "Mcm10" and "pre-replicative complex" are inserted as shortcuts to the original "Mcm10" and "pre-replicative complex" in the reaction "Mcm10 associates with the pre-replicative complex". A shortcut and its target share the same properties. One object can have multiple shortcuts.
</p>
<p>Another convenient way to attach entities to reactions is drag and drop them from a precompiled entity list generated from the Reactome central database. (Generating such lists is not covered in this tutorial.) Double click reaction node "Cdt1 is displaced from the pre-replicative complex" to open the reaction editor. Select the proteins section in the tree "Molecules from Database" (see image below), find "Cdt1 [nucleus]" in the tree, and drag and drop it to the graphic panel for reaction "Cdt1 is displaced from the pre-replicative complex". A role dialog will appear for "Cdt1 [nucleus]". Choose output (i.e., Cdt1 [nucleus] is an output of this reaction) and click OK. "Cdt1 [nucleus]" is attached to the reaction now. Other inputs and outputs can be added to the reaction.
<br />
<img src="images/EntityTree.gif" width="321" height="332"/>
<p>
Once you have created an entity or a complex in connection with one reaction, you can re-use it in other reactions. Double click reaction node "CDK and DDK associate with the Mcm10:pre-replicative complex" to open a reaction editor for this reaction. Insert "CDK" and "DDK" as two inputs. Select "Mcm10:pre-replicative complex" in the process tree and drag-and-drop it to the reaction editor. A role dialog box appears; choose input and click OK. "Mcm10:pre-replicative complex" (strictly, a shortcut to it) is inserted as an input.
</p>
<h2><a name="reference" id="reference" />8. Add references</h2>
A utility in the Author Tool allows you to download reference information directly from the PubMed. Use the File/"Close All" menu to close all opened graphic editors. Double click the pathway "Activation of the pre-replicative complex" to open a pathway editor for it. Open the Properties dialog for this pathway by using the popup menu, and select its References tab. Click the "Add" button to bring up the dialog for adding references (see below), and click the "Search PubMed" button. (If you have not specified a default browser, a file dialog will appear for you to choose the default browser.) In the PubMed search page that opens, search for "activation of the pre-replicative complex". This search yields several references. Assume you want to choose Diffley JF et al. (1995). Cut and paste its PMID - 8655649 -(just the number) into the PMID text field in the wizard dialog. Click OK button. The tool will fetch all necessary bibliographic information and create a reference for the event automatically.
<br />

<h2><a name="task" id="task" />9. Finish tasks</a></h2>

<p>The task tree lists reminders of all the information needed by the Reactome for each entity (molecule or complex) and event (reaction or pathway) you have created. To work on a task on the list, double click it and an appropriate dialog will open. After the task is done, it will be removed from the list. You can also add or remove tasks by using popup menu or buttons at the top-left corner
 (<img src="images/AddTask.gif" width="21" height="22" /> for adding tasks or <img src="images/RemoveTask.gif" width="18" height="18" /> for removing tasks).
To modify information that you have already provided (e.g., to revise a description of an event that you wrote earlier, or to add an additional reference), open the appropriate property dialog as described above.
