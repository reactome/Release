		<title>Description for Package org.gk.gpml</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This package is used to export Reactome pathways into GPML, the format used by wikipathways, and vice versa.</p>
		<p>Note that due to the nature of GPML file itself, conversion back to Reactome pathways is flaky at best.
		Currently the conversion code can only convert back GPML files that are produced from ReactomeToGPMLConverter.</p>
		
		<p>Executable Java classes (with main(String[]) method) usage documentation is included in each of the source codes.</p>
		
		<p>Note that classes that do conversion from GPML to Reactome needs Pathvisio classes to run. You can get them by:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>compiling pathvisio.jar on your own by downloading <a href="http://pathvisio.org/">Pathvisio source code</a>
			and putting pathvisio.jar in your CLASSPATH, or</li>
			<li>downloading an old version of pathvisio.jar
			<a href="http://bitbucket.org/leonth/reactome-wikipathways-exchange/raw/7d524ccb5c1c/lib/pathvisio.jar">here</a>
			and putting it in your CLASSPATH.</li>
		</ul>
